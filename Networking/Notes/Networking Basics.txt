Well in most cases, a machine is connected to the network via one medium (Wifi, Lan, etc.)

But when we use multiple apps that might be using that connection to fetch data,
how is it that the data coming through that connection knows which app/service needs it?

Ports

They are numeric codes that help wrap the received data and Route it to the respective service/app :)

What are Sockets?
-----

While using low-level APIs in Java that help us establish TCP, or any other Connection.
We use Sockets: Socket for Client Socket, ServerSocket for Server Socket :)

In case of multiple clients connecting to the same server, they use the Same Port, but an individual socket each! :)

Where Socket is an end-point of the two-way connection between the client and the server ;)
Both, server and the client have their own sockets :)
