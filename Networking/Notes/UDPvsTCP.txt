UDP
---

UDP stands for User Datagram Protocol.

* It is Used for FAST Data Transmission 
because UNLIKE TCP it *Ditches* the "HANDSHAKING" process to Initiate Connections.

Rather it simply sends Data as a Single Message!
Tho this may lead to DataLoss at times, it's extremelyyyy quick!

Examples

Apps using VOIP like Skype use UDP as transferring Real-time data needs Speed!
Plus the data is So Damn Dynamic that even if 1-2 packets drop, it's hardly noticeable :)
( That's how lag works basically ;p )
