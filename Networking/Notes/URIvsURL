Key Difference
---

The difference is fairly thin tho it is there.

URL is an Absolute Locator for a Resource,
hence it contains COMPLETE INFORMATION to access the Resource.

URI is an Identifier for a Resource,
hence it May or May Not Contain Complete Information to access the Resource,
it may only contain some information that can be used in a certain situation to identify the resource.

--
Example
--
A Url is an ABSOLUTE Path to a file, such that it can be accessed irrespective of the current directory.

A URI MAY be a relative Path to a file.

A URL has complete information, including the scheme for the resource (http OR db OR whatever we see before '://' in the path)
A URI May or May Not contain a Scheme depending upon the context ;p


---
Verdict
---
URIs are useful to reference to the resources in the code as it makes things Simpler,
tho while accessing the resource, we HAVE TO USE URLs because that's the way it is.

So we can have a root URI that has our root address, while rest of the URIs are Relative,
and whenever we need to access a certain resource, we can resolve it's relative URI using the root URI to convert to a URL ;D
