***  Interrupting a thread.
Simply do it using the interrupt() method.

This will force the thread to throw a InterruptedException
Or do what's in the catch block if the exception is catched.

** Joining a thread. (Linking)
Do so using the join() method.
It will essentially make the current thread wait till the joined thread has finished executing :)

Execute the following line in the thread that you wish to join from.
    Thread_to_Join_TO_.join();

or if you want to join for a specified time, so that the original thread continues it's work if the
joined thread doesn't terminate in the given time.
    Thread_to_Join_TO_.join( TIME_IN_MILLIS );
